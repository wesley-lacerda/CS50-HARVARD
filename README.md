#  **YEARLY GOALS MAP**

### Video Demo: https://youtu.be/WvFZUT4bQ54

## **Description:**

Every new year comes with a new list of goals, which will probably be left behind at some point.

With that in mind, this final project is an interface built with Python to help users register their personal goals. It allows users to:

	•	Add a Goal
	•	List Goals
	•	Mark a Goal as Completed
	•	Update Goal Progress
	•	View Progress
	•	Show Time Until Due
	•	Download a file containing all goal-related information

## **Project Requirements:**

☑ Your project must be implemented in Python.

☑ Your project must have a main function and at least three additional functions, each accompanied by tests that can be executed with pytest.

☑ Your main function must be in a file called project.py, which should be located in the root (i.e., top-level folder) of your project.

☑ Your three required custom functions (in addition to the main function) must also be in project.py and defined at the same indentation level as main (i.e., not nested under any classes or other functions).

☑ Your test functions must be in a file called test_project.py, which should also be located in the root of your project. Ensure they have the same name as your custom functions, prefixed with test_ (e.g., test_custom_function for a function named custom_function in project.py).

☑ You are welcome to implement additional classes and functions beyond the minimum requirements.

☑ Implementing your project should require more time and effort than any of the course’s problem sets.

☑ Any pip-installable libraries required by your project must be listed, one per line, in a file called requirements.txt in the root of your project.
